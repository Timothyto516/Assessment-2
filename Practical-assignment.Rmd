knitr::kable(thanksgiving_meals[1:10,1:10],"pipe")
```


###Q2.  Use `fct_reorder` and `parse_number` functions to create a factor variable `family_income`.

thanksgiving_meals%>%
  mutate(family_income=fct_reorder(family_income,parse_number(family_income)))%>%

knitr::kable()

```


###Q3. Generate the general statistics of the dataset using `summary()` and `skim()` function (2 mark)

thanksgiving_meals%>%
 count(main_dish,main_prep)%>%
  ggplot(aes(main_prep,n,fill=main_dish))+geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  facet_wrap(~main_dish)+
 labs(title = "The most popular way to prepare for each dish")

  
  
```

###Q7.How many use cranberry sauce? How many use gravy?
